Here is the recipe for the Peanut-Butter Themed Ice-Cream Sunday

    1. Take your fudge in a ceramic bowl and heat it up in the microwave for 3 minutes.
    2. Add 3/4 of the fudge to the bottom of your ice-cream dish.
    3. Lay a few peanut-butter cups on top of the fudge.
    4. Take some vanilla ice-cream in another bowl and add in bits of peanut-butter (but dont mix in completely).
    5. After that, add your vanilla ice-cream and peanut-butter mix to the right half of the sunday bowl.
    6. Once that is done, add your chocolate ice-cream to the left half of the bowl.
    7. Finally, drizzle the remaining 1/4 of the hot fudge onto the top of the ice-cream sunday and sprinkle on some peanut-butter cups.
